## Repository
I have provided an implementation of the statistical methods described in the paper, in the R language. The code complements the detail provided within the spreadsheet, and I recommend any users who are not familiar with the concepts or methods to use a combination of the paper, code and spreadsheet when conducting their own analysis. The analysis provided uses the mock data supplied with the paper.

Please contact me with any issues or errors at the address provided within the code file. Feel free to contact me if you are also struggling to get this to work with your own data.
